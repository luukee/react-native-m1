This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

### Now what?

# My notes

1. From the [react-native site](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?guide=native) I went with the "React Native CLI Quickstart":
- (see screenshot)
2. Install node -
- `brew install node`
3. Install watchman -
- `brew install watchman`
  - `brew reinstall watchman` even if you already have it installed (just to make sure)
4. [Make sure you have Rosetta installed](https://medium.com/bricksnbrackets/how-to-correctly-install-cocoapods-on-m1-m2-6abe3736c221) -
- `softwareupdate --install-rosetta`
5. Cocoapods uninstall whatever you did previously by running -
- `sudo gem uninstall cocoapods`
6. And then -
- `brew install cocoapods`
7. If you previously installed a global react-native-cli package, remove it as it may cause unexpected issues:
- `npm uninstall -g react-native-cli @react-native-community/cli`
8. Generate a new project -
- `npx react-native@latest init AwesomeProject`
9. cd into `AwesomeProject`
10. IMPORTANT: [Install React Native for macOS](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/rnm-getting-started) - `npx react-native-macos-init`
11. Without using Xcode: In your React Native macOS project directory, run: - `npx react-native run-macos`

#10 is all new specific to macOS, so that might be where we can fix the existing project.
